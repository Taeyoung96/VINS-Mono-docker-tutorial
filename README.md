# VINS-mono-docker-tutorial

There is a dockerfile on the original repository, but the explanation is unfriendly for beginners.  

I make my own tutorial video, just follow it line by line.  

## Requirements  
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)  
- [terminator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/terminator-a-linux-terminal-emulator/) (High recommended)  

## Dataset  

- [OpenLORIS-Scene Dataset](https://lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/dataset/scene.html)  

> If you want to use this dataset, you need to fix some bag files.  
> Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/lifelong-robotic-vision/OpenLORIS-Scene/issues/15).
